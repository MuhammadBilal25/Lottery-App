# Lottery-App
A simple Flutter application that simulates a lottery draw. The app generates a random number when the user taps the refresh button, and checks if it matches the winning number (which is fixed as 4). If the number matches, the user wins the lottery; otherwise, theyâ€™re prompted to try again.
